==========================

Savage Wheels is a 2D car crashing arcade game similar to the old classic Destruction Derby. 

Up to 4 vehicles take part in a deadly tournament. The goal is to eliminate the other derby contestants. Players may choose from a variety of vehicles each with it's unique characteristics: speed, acceleration, armor, damage and driver. Various bonuses can be collected in order to increase speed and damage or to fix vehicles. 

All drivers have background stories which are revealed when playing the campaign mode. Gameplay modes include a campaign, hot-seat mode between two players or melee mode where vehicles are controlled by the _fearsome_ game AI ;-).
